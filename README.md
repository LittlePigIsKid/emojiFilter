i create this project for the reason that oneday when we tried to fix bugs, we found that the utf8mb4 is not supportted until mySQL 5.5.3,
this brought us problems when we tried to save some emojis (coded in utf8mb4), so we just try to find those not supportted emojis and 
replace them by "".

this is the first project i host on github, anyway, always willing to hear any kind of voice.
